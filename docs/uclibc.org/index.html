<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced yew-see-lib-see)
is a C library for embedded Linux systems. It is much smaller then the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>, but
nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with uClibc.
Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves just recompiling
the source code. uClibc supports standard Linux architectures (such as x86,
strongArm, and powerpc), and also supports 
<a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
architectures such as the Coldfire, Dragonball, and ARM7TDMI micro-controllers.
If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, then using
glibc may be a better choice...

<p>

<p>
uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

    <li> <b>10 April 2002, uClibc 0.9.11 Released</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.11. This release is primarily focused on fixing the issues that
    have turned up since the last release.  Several bugs in the gcc wrapper
    have been fixed, allowing things like iproute2 and XFree86 to link properly
    now.  Large file support has been improved, and a thread locking bug was
    fixed that could cause s*printf calls to deadlock when threading was
    enabled.  Several bugs were also fixed with the powerpc, h8300, m68k,
    sparc, and mips architecture support.  Many additional applications now
    compile and run perfectly and have been added to the end of the <a
    href="uClibc-apps.html">working applications list</a> .
    <p>
    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="downloads/uClibc-0.9.11.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="downloads/">here</a>.
    <p>


    <li> <b>10 April 2002, Native uClibc/gcc-3.0.4 toolchain</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting has released source code and a Makefile
    to build a gcc-3.0.4 toolchain that natively targets uClibc.
    This brings with it full C++ support for uClibc, including the 
    libstdc++ library.  A gcc-2.95.x toolchain will also be released 
    shortly, but is not yet ready.  At this time, only source code and
    a Makefile for the native uClibc toolchain is being released (i.e.
    no binaries, sorry).  Source code can be downloaded 
    <a href="downloads/toolchain/">here</a>,
    but be aware that the source code is 27 MB.
    <p>
    To build the toolchain, simply grab the source, edit the Makefile
    to select where you would like the toolchain installed.  Then
    run 'make and wait for it to compile.  If you do not have a copy
    of uClibc already, it will download the latest daily snapshot.
    <p>


    <li> <b>21 March 2002, uClibc 0.9.10 Released!</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate
    availability of uClibc 0.9.10. This release adds pthreads support
    (including pthreads support for mmu-less systems!).  Additionally,
    thanks to Manuel Novoa III, we now have a completely new stdio
    library, which is small, standards compliant, supports pthreads,
    wide/narrow streams, large files, and can even operate in a
    low-memory unbuffered mode.  Many, many bugs have been fixed and a
    number of additional applications now compile and run perfectly.
    Even with all these changes, uClibc continues to be very small.
    On x86, a default build of the uClibc C library is still just 168k.

    <p>

    To make things more interesting, the release also adds support for
    C++ constructors and destructors.  To make it easy to use uClibc
    when developing C++ applications, this release also provides a 
    wrapper for the GNU C++ compiler.  Of course, for more complex C++
    applications, such as those using iostreams, a standard C++ library
    (libstdc++) is required.  A native GNU toolchain (binutils/gcc) that
    provides libstdc++ linked with uClibc 0.9.10 will be released in the
    next couple of days, so stay tuned.

    <p>
    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="downloads/uClibc-0.9.10.tar.bz2">Source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="downloads/">here</a>.
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>4 February 2002, uClibc 0.9.9 Released!</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate
    availability of uClibc 0.9.9.  With this release,
    <a href="uClibc-apps.html">just about 
    everything we have tested now compiles and runs</a>.  In fact,
    there are now so many programs on the working application list that 
    rather than continue to add to this list, from now on we 
    will only be adding applications to the <em>not working list</em>.  Most applications 
    on the <em>not working list</em> either require pthreads, or require 
    wide-character support.  Work on wide-character support is
    well underway, and will hopefully be moving into CVS in the next week or
    two.  Full pthreads support and rentrancy are on the TODO list
    and are expected to be complete in the next couple of months.
    <p>
    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a
    href="downloads/uClibc-0.9.9.tar.bz2">Source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="downloads/">here</a>.
    <p>
    One final bit on news -- as some of you may have noticed, uclibc.org 
    has been a bit overloaded and somewhat slow recently.  The server should 
    be getting colocated tomorrow, which will eliminate the speed problem.  
    During the move, there may be some temporary disruption of service...
    <p>
    Have Fun!

    <p>
    <li> <b>22 December 2001, uClibc 0.9.8 Released!</b>
    <br>

    After many months of initial development, we are pleased to announce the
    release of uClibc 0.9.8.  This release should be quite solid, and is very
    usable.  This also, hopefully, marks a transition from a slow incubation
    phase to a more methodical release cycle.  From now one, there should be
    approximately one release per month.

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">


Here are a few things on the TODO list:
<ul>
    <li> Shared library support for all supported architectures.
	We now have our own ld.so, but it needs to be ported to
	support each architecture. 
    <li> Shared library support for mmu-less systems.  This is
	very doable (think of C++ vtables for example), but will
	take some work.
    <li> Someone (hopefully) needs to volunteer to take the
	<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/">LSB Test Suite</a>,
	pull out the C library testing stuff, and convert it
	(perl script, by hand, I don't care how) into a form
	that is usable without having it take over your entire
	system (i.e. similar to what is currently in the uClibc
	test suite).  This will be <em>enormously</em> helpful!
    <li> other things as I think of them.
